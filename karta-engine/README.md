# Karta Engine

**Motto:** "From Data, Clarity. From Inquiry, Knowledge."

Karta Engine is a specialized, pluggable knowledge and comprehension subsystem for the Genie Tooling ecosystem. Its mission is to transform unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., text) into structured, actionable knowledge (e.g., entities, facts, summaries).

This package provides the `genie.karta` interface and a suite of agent-facing tools when installed alongside the core `genie-tooling` library.

For detailed instructions on installation, configuration, and usage, please see the [full documentation](docs/using_karta_engine.md).
